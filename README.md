GigShield
Parametric income insurance for gig workers in India. Automatically detects income disruptions due to weather, platform outages, or local events, and processes instant payouts directly to worker UPI accounts.

Features
Worker App

Onboarding wizard to set work zones, platform, and risk profile
Real-time dashboard showing active policies and earnings protection status
Policy management with Basic and Premium coverage options
Instant claim status and payout history tracking
Live weather alerts and disruption detection
Backend Platform

Automated parametric trigger detection using background scheduler
AI-powered fraud detection using historical weather data and worker behavioral signals
Real-time payout processing via UPI
Admin dashboard for risk monitoring and insights
Structured logging for observability and compliance
Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native, Expo, React Navigation, Zustand, TanStack Query

Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, APScheduler, Scikit-Learn

Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)

Getting Started
Quick Start (Windows)
Double-click START_GIGSHIELD.bat to automatically set up and launch both backend and frontend.

Manual Setup
Backend

How It Works
Worker signs up and activates a policy for their work zone
System monitors weather APIs and platform status endpoints
When a disruption is detected, a parametric trigger is activated
Eligible workers receive automatic payouts to their UPI account
Workers can track payout history in their dashboard
Architecture
The system uses parametric insurance - meaning payouts are triggered by external events (weather, platform status) rather than manual claims. No claim validation process needed, resulting in instant payouts.

Trigger Types

Heavy rainfall alerts
Temperature extremes
Platform outages
Local traffic restrictions
Development
# Run backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Run backend with hot reload
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run frontend on specific platform
cd frontend
expo start --android
expo start --ios
Deployment
Frontend (Vercel)
Push code to GitHub
Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard and import the repository
Set environment variable:
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-render-backend-url.onrender.com
Deploy
Backend (Render)
Push code to GitHub
Go to https://dashboard.render.com and create a new Web Service
Connect your GitHub repository
Set environment variables in Render dashboard:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/gigshield
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS in backend config to include Vercel URL
Deploy
Environment Variables
Local Development

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your API keys:

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Gemini API key, database URL, etc.
Production

Set environment variables directly in your cloud provider dashboard:

Vercel: Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL to your Render backend URL
Render: Set DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=False, and other vars from .env.example
Never commit .env files to git - keep API keys private.

Troubleshooting
Issue: "Login Failed: Cannot connect to the server"

This happens when the frontend cannot reach the backend API. Check:

Backend is running on correct port (8001 local, or check Render URL)
Frontend has correct backend URL in environment variables:
Local: Check frontend/src/lib/api.ts default URLs
Production: Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL in Vercel environment variables
CORS is configured correctly in backend (backend/app/core/config.py)
Network/firewall allows the connection
Prevention Checklist Before Deploying:

 Backend successfully starts and logs are clean
 Frontend environment variables point to correct backend URL
 Test login locally with demo credentials before pushing to production
 Verify Render backend URL is accessible (curl or browser test)
 Vercel build completes without errors
 Database migrations run successfully on Render
